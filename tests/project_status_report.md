## Current Focus: Token Functionality Removal

As per project requirements for private network implementation, we are removing all token-related functionality from the codebase. Progress on this task includes:

- **âœ… Event Struct Update:** Removed `TokenContext` field from `Event` struct in `types.go`
- **âœ… API Service Adaptation:** Updated `GetSystemStatus` method to remove token-related functionality
- **âœ… Router Configuration:** Confirmed no token-related routes in the API
- **âœ… Metrics Collector:** Verified that no token-related metrics are being recorded
- **âœ… Token Package Removal:** Removed the entire `token` package from the security module

**Remaining tasks:**

1. **ðŸ”„ Code Cleanup:** Ensure no remaining references to token functionality across the codebase
2. **ðŸ”„ Testing:** Verify system operation without token functionality
3. **â¬œ Documentation Update:** Update relevant documentation to reflect removal of token system

## Test Results
