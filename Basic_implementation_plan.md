## Security Enhancements

Based on the technical analysis, the following security improvements are essential:

### Environment-Based Security Configuration

The system will now enforce different security settings based on the deployment environment:

1. **Development Mode**
   - Default policy: Convenience and easy setup
   - Authentication: Optional
   - TLS: Optional
   - IP Masking: Optional
   - Provides clear warnings about insecure settings

2. **Staging Mode**
   - Default policy: Balanced security and flexibility
   - Authentication: Required
   - TLS: Required
   - IP Masking: Enabled
   - Basic rate limiting

3. **Production Mode**
   - Default policy: Maximum security (secure by default)
   - Authentication: Required and enforced
   - TLS: Required and enforced
   - IP Masking: Enabled with rotation
   - DNS privacy protection
   - Strict rate limiting
   - Verbose audit logging
   - Forced security validation for non-local deployments

This ensures that production deployments cannot accidentally run with insecure settings, while maintaining flexibility for development.
