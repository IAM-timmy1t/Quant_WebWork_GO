# Security Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the security architecture of the QUANT_WebWork_GO system, focusing on the security features, components, and how they interact to provide a comprehensive security solution.

## Components

The security system is built around three main components:

1. **Firewall System**: Provides request filtering and rate limiting
2. **IP Masking**: Hides client IP addresses
3. **Security Monitoring**: Detects and responds to security events

### Firewall System

The firewall system is responsible for filtering incoming requests based on predefined rules. It supports:

- IP-based filtering
- URL pattern matching
- HTTP header inspection
- Rate limiting
- Content inspection
- Geo-location based rules

The firewall evaluates requests against a set of rules in priority order. Each rule has an action: allow, deny, log, rate limit, or challenge.

#### Key Components:

- **Firewall Interface**: Defines the firewall API
- **FirewallImpl**: Implements the firewall logic
- **Rule**: Defines filtering rules with conditions and actions
- **RateLimiter**: Implements rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- **RequestContext**: Contains request information for evaluation

### IP Masking

The IP masking system obfuscates client IP addresses to enhance privacy. It provides:

- IPv4 and IPv6 masking
- Geolocation preservation (optional)
- Automatic IP rotation
- DNS privacy features

#### Key Components:

- **IPMasker Interface**: Defines the IP masking API
- **Manager**: Implements IP masking logic
- **MaskingOptions**: Configures IP masking behavior
- **HTTPIPMaskingMiddleware**: HTTP middleware for seamless integration

### Security Monitoring

The security monitoring system detects, analyzes, and responds to security events. It provides:

- Event collection and analysis
- Risk scoring
- Anomaly detection
- Alert generation
- Security event logging

#### Key Components:

- **Monitor**: Central component that processes security events
- **Event**: Represents a security-relevant action
- **RiskAnalyzer**: Analyzes events and assigns risk scores
- **Detector**: Detects specific security issues
- **AlertManager**: Manages security alerts

## Integration

These components are integrated through the `SecurityManager`, which:

1. Initializes and configures all security components
2. Provides a unified API for security operations
3. Creates HTTP middleware chains for web applications
4. Manages component lifecycle (start/stop)

## Request Flow

When a request comes in:

1. **IP Masking Middleware** masks the client IP address
2. **Firewall Middleware** evaluates the request against firewall rules
   - If blocked, returns an appropriate HTTP error
   - If rate-limited, returns 429 Too Many Requests
3. **Security Monitoring Middleware** logs the request as a security event
4. If all checks pass, the request proceeds to the application handlers

## Configuration

Security components can be configured through options:

- `SecurityManager.Options`: Top-level configuration
- `ipmasking.MaskingOptions`: IP masking configuration
- `firewall.Rule`: Firewall rules
- `security.Config`: Security monitoring configuration

## Implementation Patterns

The security system follows these design patterns:

1. **Interface-based design**: Components are defined by interfaces for flexibility
2. **Middleware pattern**: Security is applied as HTTP middleware
3. **Builder pattern**: Fluent configuration of components
4. **Observer pattern**: Notification of security events

## Threat Mitigation

The security system addresses the following threats:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Brute force attacks | Rate limiting, account lockout |
| DDoS attacks | Rate limiting, IP filtering |
| Data exfiltration | Content inspection, anomaly detection |
| Suspicious access | Geo-blocking, time-based rules |
| Privacy concerns | IP masking, header sanitization |

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. Machine learning-based anomaly detection
2. Integration with threat intelligence feeds
3. Enhanced fingerprinting resistance
4. Web Application Firewall (WAF) features
5. CAPTCHA and browser challenges
