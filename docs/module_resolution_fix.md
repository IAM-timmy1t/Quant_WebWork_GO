# Module Resolution Fix

## Problem Description

The project is experiencing issues with Go module resolution and vendoring inconsistencies:

```
Error loading workspace: packages.Load error: err: exit status 1: stderr: go: inconsistent vendoring in Z:\.CodingProjects\GitHub_Repos\Quant_WebWork_GO...
```

This is causing the workspace to fail loading and preventing the normal development workflow.

## Root Causes

1. Inconsistency between `go.mod` and `vendor/modules.txt`
2. Module path resolution issues (likely from moving the project or changing module names)
3. Windows path handling with backslashes causing issues in the Go module system

## Implementation Protocol

Follow this structured approach to resolve the issues:

### 1. Pre-Implementation Setup

```bash
# Create restore points before making changes
Copy-Item -Path "go.mod" -Destination "go.mod.bak" -Force
Copy-Item -Path "go.sum" -Destination "go.sum.bak" -Force
```

### 2. Bypass Vendoring Temporarily

```bash
# Set environment to ignore vendor directory
$env:GOFLAGS="-mod=mod"
go env -w GOFLAGS="-mod=mod"
```

### 3. Development Workflow

For development, use the following command pattern to run Go commands:

```bash
go run -mod=mod cmd/server/main.go
go test -mod=mod ./...
```

This ensures that Go will download modules directly rather than using the inconsistent vendor directory.

### 4. Security Considerations

- This approach bypasses vendoring which may have security implications for production
- For production builds, use a clean environment and re-vendor dependencies properly
- This is a temporary development workflow fix only

### 5. Long-Term Resolution

Once immediate development needs are met:

1. Consider recreating the module from scratch
2. Ensure consistent import paths throughout the codebase
3. Run `go mod tidy` and then `go mod vendor` in a clean environment
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to verify vendoring consistency

## Implementation Verification

Confirm this fix with:

```bash
# Verify modules are downloading properly
go list -mod=mod all
```

## Rollback Strategy

If issues persist:

```bash
# Restore backed up files
Copy-Item -Path "go.mod.bak" -Destination "go.mod" -Force
Copy-Item -Path "go.sum.bak" -Destination "go.sum" -Force
```
