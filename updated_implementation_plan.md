# Updated Implementation Plan for QUANT_WW_GO

## Current Status and Issues

The project has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Import Path Problems**: Many import statements have incorrect paths with redundant segments:
   - `github.com/IAM-timmy1t/Quant_WebWork_GO/QUANT_WW_GO/QUANT_WW_GO/...` instead of `github.com/IAM-timmy1t/Quant_WebWork_GO/...`

2. **Vendor Directory**: Currently included in version control, which is not necessary with Go modules.

3. **Potentially Unused Token Management Files**: Several files related to token management may be irrelevant to the project.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix Import Paths

Use the created `fix_imports.ps1` script to systematically fix all import paths across the codebase:

```powershell
.\fix_imports.ps1
```

This script:
- Recursively finds all Go files (excluding vendor and .git directories)
- Replaces incorrect import paths with correct ones
- Runs `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies
- Verifies the Go module integrity

### 2. Exclude Vendor Directory from Git

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to include the vendor directory, preventing it from being committed to the repository. If you need vendored dependencies for any reason:

```powershell
# Generate vendor directory when needed
go mod vendor
```

### 3. Identify and Remove Unused Files

Run the project audit script to identify potential token management files that may be irrelevant:

```powershell
.\project_audit.ps1
```

Review identified files and remove them if they are not needed.

### 4. Verify Project Structure

Use the audit script to verify that all required directories and files exist:

```powershell
.\project_audit.ps1
```

Create any missing directories or files according to the original project plan.

### 5. Test Building and Running

Verify that the project builds and runs correctly:

```powershell
# Build the server
go build ./cmd/server

# Run the server
go run ./cmd/server/main.go
```

### 6. Continue Implementation According to Original Plan

Following the original implementation plan:

- ✅ Go backend with gRPC, REST, GraphQL
- ✅ React (TypeScript) frontend for monitoring & interaction
- ✅ Prometheus + Grafana for full observability
- ✅ Dockerized, with CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## Project Structure (as defined in original plan)

## Features to Implement

- 🔌 Bridge Module: Plug-and-play protocol support (gRPC, WebSocket, REST)
- 🌐 API Layer: REST + GraphQL with middleware, validation, CORS
- 📊 Monitoring: Custom Prometheus metrics from Go and React
- 🔐 Security: Rate limiting, token validation, risk scoring
- ⚙️ Discovery: Service registry, health checking
- 🔍 Test Coverage: Jest + Cypress + Go unit tests
- 📦 CI/CD: GitHub Actions auto builds, runs tests, lints code

## Launch and Testing

Once the project is fully implemented:

1. **Launch with Docker Compose**:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access Services**:
   - Backend & Frontend: http://localhost:8080
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

3. **Run Tests**:
   - Go tests: `go test ./...`
   - Frontend tests: `cd web/client && npm run test`
   - E2E tests: `cd web/client && npx cypress open`
   - Bridge verification: `cd tests && go run bridge_verification.go manual`
